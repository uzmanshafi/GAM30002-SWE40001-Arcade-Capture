# Tower Defense Game Capstone Project

This repository hosts the source code for Arcade Capture, a retro arcade tower defence game. This project is a collaborative effort between students of the Bachelor of Computer Science and Bachelor of Games and Interactivity programs at Swinburne University, as part of the SWE 40001 SEPA and SEPB units.

## Concept

You play as an arcade manager trying to maintain your 5 star rating. The arcade machines are your towers and the customers are your enemies. Everytime a customer enters your arcade, your arcade machines use their abilities to entertain the customers and to prevent them from causing damage by leaving bad reviews.

## Team

The Arcade Capture team is composed of dedicated students from the Computer Science and Games and Interactivity programs.
